# Summer of Tech - Intro to JavaScript

## Setup instructions

### Getting the project

If you are comfortable with git you can clone this repo as a starting point. If
you have a GitHub account you can fork this repo and clone a local copy of that
so you can keep your changes more easily.

If you don't know git, you can just download the zip file by clicking the green
`Clone or download` button and the selecting the `Download zip` option. Make
sure you extract the folder properly to somewhere easily accessible on your hard
disk.

### Working through building the project

You don't need a server for this tutorial, you can just open up `index.html` in
Chrome or Firefox (locate the file in your file browser program and right click
and select `Open with <yourbrowser>`). Keep that browser open and handy while
you follow along so you can check your code is working.

I recommend installing a good code-focused text editor  (if you don't have one
already) to work on following along, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) (which is
free and open-source).

Most of the code you will be adding will go into either `index.html`,
`js/main.js` and `css/main.css`, so open those up in your code editor.

### If you get stuck

There are example finished versions of the project that you can look at the code
for, by looking through the code on the branches
[jquery-example](https://github.com/jenofdoom/summer-of-tech-intro-js/tree/jquery-example)
and
[vue-example](https://github.com/jenofdoom/summer-of-tech-intro-js/tree/vue-example)
on GitHub.
